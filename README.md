College students often struggle with engaging with their coursework, largely due to a lack of clarity on how it aligns with future career paths and the qualifications employers seek. After thorough interviews with stakeholders, our research has shown that professors often struggle to adjust the content of courses to current skills in the market. Even our conversation with President Gilliam validated the existence of this problem at the institution. We have identified a few main causes for this problem including, but not limited to, difficulties navigating the opportunities, a disconnect with the workforce, and an outdated curriculum. Currently, there is no tool or direct strategy to engage students in a way that drives them to take each and every class because they understand how it benefits them, instead of having students feel they are taking classes because they are told to do so. If left unresolved, this issue may lead to missed opportunities to improve alumni job satisfaction, boost employment recruitment of Boston University students, increase student engagement, enhance course content, and strengthen the universityâ€™s reputation and retention rates. The goal is to identify and implement a solution that will foster meaningful student engagement with their career pathways.
